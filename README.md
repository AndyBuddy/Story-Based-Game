# Story-Based-Game

This game is a small project. The text was made mostly by ChatGPT, 
pictures created by Midjourney, and the ideas for the story were 
created by myself to an extent.
It could have been longer, but time played a part. The story itself 
is not very creative, I was mostly just messing around with 
AI to generate a story and picturesfor the story. 

I don't recomend extending the window it is played (smaller window works best). Due to time
constraints and my lack of skills when it comes to CSS I was unable to 
properly adjust the background according to the window size.
